### Welcome to my website

# My name is Karmen Browitt. I'm currently a German Master's student at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. My academic interests include German literature and working within the digital humanities field. 

# This website will showcase the author Onoto Watanna (Winnifred Eaton). She was an author who published fiction novels and articles, cookbooks, and wrote a memoir. Some of her most famous publications include Miss Nume of Japan (1899), Japanese Nightingale (1900), and Chinese-Japanese Cookbook (1914). Many of her fictional literary works focus on interracial relationships and perspectives, which stems from Watanna a having British-Japanese heritage.  

# _Stay tuned!_
